**Ludum Dare 40: Crazy Kitchen 72hr Jam**

https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/crazy-kitchen

Me and my friend participated in the 40th Ludum Dare game jam. The theme was "The more you have, the worse it gets." We thought about a restaurant scenario, and how
by having more customers, the more hectic the work gets.

I feel more confident with using git now, albeit through an interface like Sourcetree. During the past 3 days we had many merge conflicts and errors, however we discovered ways of working in particular with Unity and how it deals with scenes. We came up with a rule similar to the post it note rule. Only one of us was allowed to work on a piece of code/scene/asset at a time.
