Me and my friend are going to do Ludum dare together. Even though there I have a ton of uni work to do... I think this will be a good change from working on the same projects for the past few weeks.

I hope to improve my 3d modelling skills by the end of the event.
Even if we don't finish, I won't mind. Working under this pressure is good practice I think.
