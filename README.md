## Exercises

### _Identify the basic elements in a game of your choice (actions, goals, rules, playspace, players)_


### Rocket League

#### Actions: 
- The basic actions are **accelerate brake rotate** and **reverse**, and also **boost** and **jump**. 
- These actions interact with other objects and each other to form new actions such as **Hitting the ball** (movement + ball), **Tackling other players**, and **collecting boost** from boost pads. 

#### Goals: 
- The objective of the game is to **score more points than your opponent before the time runs out**. The player scores a point for their team by getting the ball in the opposite team’s net. There are also meta objectives such as increasing your skill rating and collecting cosmetics for your car.

#### Rules: 
- A goal is scored when the ball goes into the net.
- A game lasts 5 minutes. If there is no winner by then, extra time is added and the first team to score a goal will win. 
- Your car will be destroyed if another player impacts you at a high speed. You will respawn at your goal after a brief period.
- There is a speed limit and constant gravity affecting the ball and also your car.

#### Objects:
- The Ball - affected by gravity and collision from players.
- The Players - control cars around an arena.
- The Nets - define the zone where the ball needs to get to.
- The Arena - the playspace in which the game takes place in. there are different variations the players can choose from.
- The BoostPads - gives a player boost when collided with.

#### Playspace
- There is a standard arena which most games take place on, however the players can decide to play on different arenas with small variations such as basketball hoops instead of nets and higher curved walls etc. 

#### Players
- Matches can only be played 2v2, 3v3, or 4v4. 
- Each player controls one car.
- Solo players can play against bots
- Players are separated depending on their region to minimise latency.

### _As a thought experiment, swap one element between two games: a single rule, one action, the goal or the playspace._

A turn based game of football? (Change Rules)
When the referee blows the whistle, the players can move one limb. ??? 
would the ball be kicked with enough force?
what about tackling and fouls?
This game would take really long to play.
You could bluff your opponent into thinking you were gonna make a different move than you did.
would prioritise strategy and mind games over finesse and agility.
Darts but each player has a dartboard attached to them. (Change Playspace)
what a stupid idea.
people would get hurt most likely.
maybe it would be funny
can the players move about?
is the goal to hit the board or the player?
if the player is hurt he cant move, now you can score easy points
you’ve basically made a fps game.

### _Pick a simple game you played as a child. Try to map out its space of possibility, taking into account the goals, actions objects, rules, and playspace as the parameters inside of which you played the game._

When me and my brother were kids, we used to play a game with our best friend who would come over every Saturday. we called the game SATURDAY! the game was about who could bounce the bouncy ball the highest.

#### Rules:
- You could only play SATURDAY! on a Saturday
- Only the same three players could play it.
- You could only play it in front of our house. 
- You had to shout SATURDAY! otherwise the bounce wouldnt count.
- The winner was the person with the highest or coolest bounce.
- The winner would have Saturday priveleges.

The fun of the game came when the ball would bounce off the environment and onto other things in interesting ways. 
My house was right next to a busy 4 lane road.

Although we never threw the ball into the traffic explicitly, it happened on many occasions. This was the result we were all hoping for. The ball would bounce on coaches, cars, and even cyclists. 

_(note: If i was an adult there now I would have stopped my 11 year old self.)_
 
The actions we could take were to **Bounce**, **Aim**, and **Move** about.

The objects involved were the ball, players and environment. We had many different bouncy balls since we lost so many. These would affect the bounce height, direction and impact.
The player could also throw the ball in different ways. 

#### Map of possibility space
- [Actions] Move to a good spot and Bounce ball
- Our Pavement
  - Ball bounces into garden
  - bounces off tree
  - ends in the grass
  - falls into the gutter
  - Ball bounces high
  - bounces on roof
  - bounces on balcony.
  - Ball bounces into another zone.
- Neighbour’s pavement
  - bounces into postbox
    - bounces even higher
    - bounces into another zone
  - Ball bounces high
  - bounces into neighbour’s balcony
  - Ball bounces into another zone.
- Pavement near road.
  - Ball bounces off barrier between road and pavement
  - Ball bounces high
  - Bounces into road
  - ball bounces into grass.
  - no traffic
  - traffic
  - interesting bounces.
    - Ball bounces into another zone.
