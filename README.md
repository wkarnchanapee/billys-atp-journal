#### Actions: 
- The basic actions are **accelerate brake rotate** and **reverse**, and also **boost** and **jump**. 
- These actions interact with other objects and each other to form new actions such as **Hitting the ball** (movement + ball), **Tackling other players**, and **collecting boost** from boost pads. 

#### Goals: 
- The objective of the game is to **score more points than your opponent before the time runs out**. The player scores a point for their team by getting the ball in the opposite team’s net. There are also meta objectives such as increasing your skill rating and collecting cosmetics for your car.

#### Rules: 
- A goal is scored when the ball goes into the net.
- A game lasts 5 minutes. If there is no winner by then, extra time is added and the first team to score a goal will win. 
- Your car will be destroyed if another player impacts you at a high speed. You will respawn at your goal after a brief period.
- There is a speed limit and constant gravity affecting the ball and also your car.

#### Objects:
- The Ball - affected by gravity and collision from players.
- The Players - control cars around an arena.
- The Nets - define the zone where the ball needs to get to.
- The Arena - the playspace in which the game takes place in. there are different variations the players can choose from.
- The BoostPads - gives a player boost when collided with.

#### Playspace
- There is a standard arena which most games take place on, however the players can decide to play on different arenas with small variations such as basketball hoops instead of nets and higher curved walls etc. 

#### Players
- Matches can only be played 2v2, 3v3, or 4v4. 
- Each player controls one car.
- Solo players can play against bots
- Players are separated depending on their region to minimise latency.

_Pick a simple game you played as a child. Try to map out its space of possibility, taking into account the goals, actions objects, rules, and playspace as the parameters inside of which you played the game._

When me and my brother were kids, we used to play a game with our best friend who would come over every Saturday. we called the game SATURDAY! the game was about who could bounce the bouncy ball the highest.

#### Rules:
- You could only play SATURDAY! on a Saturday and only the same three players could play it. Also you could only play it in front of my house. 

The fun of the game came when the ball would bounce off the environment and onto other things in interesting ways. 
My house was right next to a busy 4 lane road.
the postbox and onto a neighbour’s window. Resulting in us running away and hiding as the neighbour would come out to check what had happened. 

Although we never threw the ball into the traffic explicitly, it happened on many occasions. This was the result we were all hoping for. The ball would bounce on coaches, cars, and even cyclists. (note: If i was an adult there now I would have stopped my 11 year old self.)

The winner was the highest or most coolest bounce by the time we got bored. 
The actions we could take were to Bounce, Aim, and Move about.
The objects involved were the ball, players and environment. We had many different bouncy balls since we lost so many. These would affect the bounce height, direction and impact.
The player could also throw the ball in different ways. 
The only rule that was important was that you had to shout SAT-TURDAY! when you threw the ball.

#### Map of possibility space
- [Actions] Move to a good spot and Bounce ball
- Our Pavement
  - Ball bounces into garden
  - bounces off tree
  - ends in the grass
  - falls into the gutter
  - Ball bounces high
  - bounces on roof
  - bounces on balcony.
  - Ball bounces into another zone.
Neighbour’s pavement
bounces into postbox
bounces even higher
bounces into another zone
