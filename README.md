## Week 1

_Identify the basic elements in a game of your choice (actions, goals, rules, playspace, players)_
Rocket League 
# Actions: 
- The basic actions are accelerate brake rotate and reverse, and also boost and jump. 
- These actions interact with other objects and each other to form new actions such as Hitting the ball, (movement + ball) Tackling other players, and collecting boost from boost pads. 
# Goals: 
- The objective of the game is to score more points than your opponent before the time runs out. The player scores a point for their team by getting the ball in the opposite teamâ€™s net. There are also meta objectives such as increasing your skill rating and collecting cosmetics for your car.
# Rules: 
- A goal is scored when the ball goes into the net.
- A game lasts 5 minutes. If there is no winner by then, extra time is added and the first team to score a goal will win. 
- Your car will be destroyed if another player impacts you at a high speed. You will respawn at your goal after a brief period.
- There is a speed limit and constant gravity affecting the ball and also your car.
# Objects:
- The Ball - affected by gravity and collision from players.
- The Players - control cars around an arena.
- The Nets - define the zone where the ball needs to get to.
- The Arena - the playspace in which the game takes place in. there are different variations the players can choose from.
- The BoostPads - gives a player boost when collided with.
# Playspace
- There is a standard arena which most games take place on, however the players can decide to play on different arenas with small variations such as basketball hoops instead of nets and higher curved walls etc. 
# Players
- Matches can only be played 2v2, 3v3, or 4v4. 
- Each player controls one car.
- Solo players can play against bots
- Players are separated depending on their region to minimise latency.
