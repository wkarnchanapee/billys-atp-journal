###### Equivilent Exchange

Death Stranding's new trailer came out yesterday. I watched it in the morning and now I'm really curious to what Hideo Kojima is making. (as stupid as it sounds) It really put me in the mood of questioning our existence, and what the hell we are meant for. So I decided to finish watching Full Metal Alchemist.

The last time I watched this was probably around 2009,
A lot of its themes appeal to me. What does it mean to be human? The meaning of life. Sacrifice and Brotherhood. etc..

The show also repeatedly makes the point of equivalent exchange; **that something cannot be created from nothing.**
For instance,
- It takes energy for me to move
- I got that energy from eating food,
- my food grew from plants and animals, which ultimately fed on sunlight to grow.
- The cycle continues - one day I will be gone and my matter will be consumed by nature.

This is our reality.

**But in most games, we often instantiate objects out of nothing.**

There are mechanics that are limited. _Ammo, lives, health._ Once the player runs out of these things they are no long available to the player.

Wouldn't it be cool if we introduced some sort of _equivalent exchange_ to our games?
