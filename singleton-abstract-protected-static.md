Abstract Classes - When you want a class's children to have to have a function or variable you can use the abstract keyword I think.

Protected - once inside the child class, if you want to use inherited variables you need to make sure they are set to the right permission level. Protected level means that a class's child can get to that class's variables.

Static Members -
A static member of a class is something that can be called just by typing Classname.StaticMember. You dont need to have an instance of an object.
For example, i could get GameController.SpawnPoint straight from the class rather than having to reference an instance

Singletons -
Easily refer to single instance, like the Game Controller.
Using static variables I can create a single instance of a class on awake and store it in Classname.Instance.

private static GameManager Instance {get; private set;}

Why do people name some variables with an _at the begining?
