**The Second Law of Thermodynamics.**

The second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy can never decrease over time for an isolated system, that is, a system in which neither energy nor matter can enter nor leave. The total entropy can remain constant in ideal cases where the system is in a steady state (equilibrium), or is undergoing a reversible process. In all other real cases, the total entropy always increases and the process is irreversible. The increase in entropy accounts for the irreversibility of natural processes, and the asymmetry between future and past.

**Isolated System. Entropy.**

This is interesting in terms of game design, especially in competitive games. By having an equilibrium of power between agents, a tug of war dynamic emerges. You have to be careful not to design a snowball situation where power leads to more dominance. having catchup mechanisms is important, otherwise a player may feel that the game is lost and completely lose interest.

_I have felt this way a couple of times during a 50minute game of DotA where it's clear that we have lost but for some reason we're still sitting here._
