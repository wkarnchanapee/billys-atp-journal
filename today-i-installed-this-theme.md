So I sorta figured out how to use Github pages better. Yesterday I was trying to setup Jekyll but it's still a bit confusing to me. Instead, I've just set up some markdown templates, I've got a default page template with a link to the homepage at the bottom.
ive also installed some handy atom packages to help me
heres a picture that i added with a keybind

Its quite easy but it doesnt format that well.
I can also quickly preview my page with another plugin. (Markdown preview) Ctrl-Shift-M
